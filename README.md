Golang training web application to learn how to build production-ready web applications with Go, built while reading Alex Edwards "Letâ€™s Go" book.

The original sample was changed while writing to learn how to use other third party Go libraries and to enhance the web application. Below a list of used libraries:
  * [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog): fast and structured logging
  * [lumberjack](https://github.com/natefinch/lumberjack): log rolling files
  * [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra): command like support
  * [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper): flags and file configuration
  * [goland-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate): sql database migration

The _docker_ folder contains a simple docker compose with a  reaady-to-use development mysql database.
